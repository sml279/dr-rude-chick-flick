FORMATTING WRONG! WILL MAKE PDF OF FIRST CHAPTER ONCE DONE. ROUGH DRAFT
INT. HOSPITAL BATHROOM
Room is a bit dingy, not as clean as it should be. Man
bursts in heavily panting, verge of tears.
This is JACOB FOSTER, he is about 35, tall, most likely
athletic in youth but that was a long time ago. He has
slightly ruffled light brown hair and a some five-o-clock
shadow. He’s wearing a hospital gown over his casual
business attire. From the back you see his shirt is
untucked.
He runs into a stall. We hear sounds violent vomiting. He
stumbles out of the stall wiping off his face with his
sleeve.
He stands over the sink an stares intensely in the mirror.
He looks exhausted, almost dead. Tears start to well up in
his eyes but he wipes them away like he did the vomit.
A Doctor walks into the bathroom, rather briskly. She is
about 40, short, and a bit stocky. She walks up to Jacob.
Jacob turns and looks at her, a desperate expression on his
face.
JACOB
So...? How is she?
The doctor looks back into Jacob’s eyes. She places her hand
on his shoulder. Jacob knows what’s coming and starts to
break down.
DOCTOR
I’m sorry Mr. Foster. Your wife...
She fought hard, and we did all we
could. But... she didn’t make it.
Jacob starts crying profusely. The doctor tries to offer
support but there is only so much she can do.
DOCTOR
I know this is hard Mr. Foster. But
you have to be strong. Be strong
for your daughter.
Jacob looks shocked. He straightens up. Wipes his tears.
JACOB
What? You mean?
DOCTOR
Yes. The baby made it. Would you
like to meet her?
(CONTINUED)

JACOB
Of course. This is... incredible
The doctor leads Jacob out of the bathroom.
INT. HOSPITAL MATERNITY WARD
Jacob is standing, trying to collect himself. The doctor
comes in and hands him a small baby wrapped in a pink
blanket. He holds the child. She is sleeping
JACOB
Oh my God... She’s perfect
Jacob smiles. Tears start to stream down his face.
JACOB(V.O.)
I suppose as one door closes,
another one opens.
