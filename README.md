## The original comment
>My wife died whilst giving birth to our daughter, so naturally my daughter and I are very close. From a young age she would spend her spare time volunteering to help children who were ill or dying, and as she is a musician, she would also teach the children at the hospital I work at how to play the piano and guitar. Along with her kindness, she is the most beautiful young woman I have ever laid my eyes on. She has the sweetest smile and her mothers big blue eyes.

>When she brought home this scruffy looking guy who hadn't done well in school, who was unemployed and trying to make his band successful, I didn't like him at all. I'm very sorry if I offend anybody but I just couldn't understand the attraction she had to him and hoped it would fade into nothing. She could do better.
>
>About a year into their relationship, my daughter discovered that she was pregnant. My heart sunk, not because I didn't want a grand-child, but because I knew she hadn't planned it and I knew she was too kind to ever consider an alternative to keeping it.
>
>Her boyfriend approached me one evening shortly after the pregnancy was announced, with a bottle of whiskey and asked if we could talk. I accepted the offer and we sat down and had a drink together. He confessed that he was scared to have a child but how he had already started saving money and how he'd started looking for a job. He explained how he knew that he wasn't good enough for my daughter but that he loved her with all of his heart and wanted to support her in her choice - even if that meant throwing away his music dreams.
>
>I will admit, we both got very drunk and ended up getting along well. This boy I had first judged was actually a very nice, warm gentleman who simply wanted the best for my daughter and their future child. That was good enough for me, so I invited him to live with us and got him a job working at the same hospital I work for.
>
>Today, I have two grand-children and my daughter and future son-in-law are getting hitched next weekend.
